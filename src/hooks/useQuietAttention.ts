 * says a "slow down, look around" line (handled by VoiceAudio.play — fails
 * silently when the audio file is missing or muted). After firing, the
 * window resets and a DEDUP_MS cooldown prevents back-to-back nagging.
 *
 * Intentionally forgiving: the very first view change in a session won't
 * fire because there's only one timestamp in the window.
